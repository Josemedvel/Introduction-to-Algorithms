# Introduction to Algorithms
An implementation of the algorithms shown in the book "Introduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition" written by Thomas H.Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein
The idea is to have several implementations of same algorithms and data structures in different languages.
